A Static displacement study:
Visualisation:
•	(maybe, start from a “potential Fishable area” is the entire pop distribution for a given fleet segment)
•	Then compute the actual fishable area (restricted by bathymetry or bottom types)
•	Then compute the future fishable area (if scenarios on pop distribution changes)
•	Then tabulate and draw histograms
*       displace effort with rules of thumb 
*       pass the overall or case study specific effort reallocation layer to partners 

Static reallocation effect on contribution margin or GVA:
•	Start from LPUEs layers (built upon VMS per metier-FDI rectangle or AER coupling)
•	Filter out population distribution areas with low abundance?
•	Overlay current fishable areas => tabulation
•	Overlay future fishable areas => tabulation
•	Displace effort on buffers with rules of thumb….(PER METIER (we have effort, lpue and costs...) based on AER costs, sediment types? including habitat preferences? (BTW find out these preferences e.g. from overlaying fishing pressure to sediment types and tabulate effort per habitat) etc., but would it need to increase the overall effort for fishermen trying to compensate for the loss?? In case the effort is already not limiting)
•	Deduce catch and contribution margin per métier before/after (i.e. in each destination Csquare, compute new_contrib_margin=(initvalue-initcosts)+((extraeffort*lpue)-costs),  plus possibly with a CPUE –E relationship to account fro effort concentration effect)
•	Deduce effect on RBS from a SAR….
*       Deduce effect on bycatch
•	Ignore selectivity effects for now?
