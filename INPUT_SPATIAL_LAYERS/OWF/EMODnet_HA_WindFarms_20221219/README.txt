The database on offshore wind farms in the EU was created in 2014 by CETMAR for the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet).
 It is the result of the aggregation and harmonization of datasets provided by several sources.
 It is updated every year and is available for viewing and download on EMODnet Human Activities web portal ( https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities). 
The database contains points and/or (where available) polygons representing offshore wind farms in the following countries: 
Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. 
Each point has the following attributes (where available): Name, NÂº of turbines, Status (Approved, Planned, Dismantled, Construction, Production, Test site), 
Country, Year, Power (MW), Distance to coast (metres) and Area (square kilometres). 
The distance to coast (EEA coastline shapefile) has been calculated using the UTM WGS84 Zone projected coordinate system where data fall in.
